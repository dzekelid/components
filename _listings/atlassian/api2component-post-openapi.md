  /api/2/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/attachments:
    post:
      summary: Add attachment
      description: |-
        Add one or more attachments to an issue.

        This resource expects a multipart post. The media-type multipart/form-data is defined in RFC 1867. Most client libraries have classes that make dealing with multipart posts simple. For instance, in Java the Apache HTTP Components library provides a [MultiPartEntity](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpmime/apidocs/org/apache/http/entity/mime/MultipartEntity.html) that makes it simple to submit a multipart POST.

        In order to protect against XSRF attacks, because this method accepts multipart/form-data, it has XSRF protection on it. This means you must submit a header of X-Atlassian-Token: no-check with the request, otherwise it will be blocked.

        The name of the multipart/form-data parameter that contains attachments must be "file"

        A simple example to upload a file called "myfile.txt" to issue REST-123:

        curl -D- -u admin:admin -X POST -H "X-Atlassian-Token: no-check" -F "file=@myfile.txt" http://myhost/rest/api/2/issue/TEST-123/attachments

      parameters:
      - in: path
        name: issueIdOrKey
        description: the issue that you want to add the attachments to
