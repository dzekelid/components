        Add one or more attachments to an issue.

        This resource expects a multipart post. The media-type multipart/form-data is defined in RFC 1867. Most client libraries have classes that make dealing with multipart posts simple. For instance, in Java the Apache HTTP Components library provides a [MultiPartEntity](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/httpmime/apidocs/org/apache/http/entity/mime/MultipartEntity.html) that makes it simple to submit a multipart POST.

        In order to protect against XSRF attacks, because this method accepts multipart/form-data, it has XSRF protection on it. This means you must submit a header of X-Atlassian-Token: no-check with the request, otherwise it will be blocked.

        The name of the multipart/form-data parameter that contains attachments must be "file"

        A simple example to upload a file called "myfile.txt" to issue REST-123:

        curl -D- -u admin:admin -X POST -H "X-Atlassian-Token: no-check" -F "file=@myfile.txt" http://myhost/rest/api/2/issue/TEST-123/attachments

      parameters:
      - in: path
        name: issueIdOrKey
        description: the issue that you want to add the attachments to

  /api/2/notificationscheme:
    get:
      summary: Get notification schemes paginated
      description: |-
        Returns a [paginated](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/#pagination) list of [notification schemes](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg) in order by display name.

        ### About notification schemes

        A notification scheme is a list of events and recipients who will receive notifications for those events. The list is contained within the `notificationSchemeEvents` object and contains pairs of `events` and `notifications`:

        *   `event` Identifies the type of event. The events can be [Jira system events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-eventsEvents) or [custom events](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/AIlKLg).
        *   `notifications` Identifies the [recipients](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8YdKLg#Creatinganotificationscheme-recipientsRecipients) of notifications for each event. Recipients can be any of the following types:

        *   `CurrentAssignee`
        *   `Reporter`
        *   `CurrentUser`
        *   `ProjectLead`
        *   `ComponentLead`
        *   `User` (the `parameter` is the user key)
        *   `Group` (the `parameter` is the group name)
        *   `ProjectRole` (the `parameter` is the project role ID)
        *   `EmailAddress`
        *   `AllWatchers`
        *   `UserCustomField` (the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)
        *   `GroupCustomField`(the `parameter` is the ID of the custom field)

        _Note that you should allow for events without recipients to appear in responses._

        **[Permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/FQiiLQ) required:** None, however the requesting user must have permission to administer at least one project associated with a notification scheme for it to be returned.
